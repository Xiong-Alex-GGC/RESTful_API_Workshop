# RESTful API Workshop

Welcome to the **RESTful API Workshop**!

In this workshop, we'll demonstrate a **RESTful API** in action. We'll leverage **MySQL** for the database and **React** for the frontend.

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **Express** installed as dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in your terminal to install the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend.
2. **Start the Application**: Use `npm start` to start the application.

Let's dive into the world of **RESTful APIs** together!

Note: The Completed-Backend directory is for refrence. It is what the backend should look like when completed
